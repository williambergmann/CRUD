### Setup
* yarn install, yarn start
* Don’t use this readme to figure out what code to type
* Use all other projects we have done as code examples
* Pick a real life thing to use as a model. Vehicle, Product, Movie …etc

Weather Forecast
* Implement 5 properties for this model.
Current Location, Temperature, and 5 Day Forecast with Day of the Week, Weather Condition, High Temp, and Low Temp

## Client
* Client code goes in client/src

### React
* Create a function component that list out a collection of your models (ListOfUsers)
    * Use prop types to define what props the component needs
    * It should probably need a prop named after the plural of your model, and it should probably be an array
    * Probably want to map over this array and create some divs or li’s showing 3 of the properties of the item
    * Create a Link on each item so you can navigate to the detail page 
    * Create a button on each item so you can delete the item
* Create a class component that makes a new model (redux fetch practice)
    * Create a form and a button
    * Put a label and an input for each property your model has
    * Bonus - use a drop down if there are a limited number of values for a property
    * Register onChange for each input and use setState to store the information typed in
    * Register onSubmit for the form. 
    * onSubmit call an action called createThing(change it to make sense for your model)
* Create a function component that shows details of one thing (UserDetail)
    * Use a prop that has the array of your models
    * Use a parameter from the route path /:id to find the model to show
    * Use whatever html you want to show all of the properties of your thing
* App.js
    * componentDidMount, call loadThings
    
### React Router
* Import necessary components from react-router-dom into App.js
* Make sure to wrap everything in BrowserRouter
* Create a route to show the list container
* Create a route to show the create container
* Create a route to show the detail container. Make sure this route has a variable in it
* Make sure to wrap all routes in Switch
* Create links to the list and create routes, put them anywhere in App.js outside of the Switch. 

### Redux

    * The only state you need is an array of your models
        * state.js
    * Create actions for loading your models and models loaded
        * loadThings() - do a fetch get to “/things”
        * thingsLoaded(things) - THINGS_LOADED
    * Create an action for saving a new model
        * createThing(thing) - do a fetch post to “/things”
        * when the fetch is complete, dispatch to loadThings
    * Create an action for deleting an item
        * deleteThing(id) - do a fetch delete to “/things/” + id
        * when the fetch is complete, dispatch to loadThings
    * Create reducer for the state
        * care about the action THINGS_LOADED
    * Create containers for all of you components
        * mapStateToProps and mapDispatchToProps
        * The list component container should mapStateToProps for the array of things
        * The list component container should mapDispatchToProps for the deleteThing action
        * The new thing component container should mapDispatchToProps for the saveThingAction
        * AppContainer should mapDispatchToProps for loadThings.

## Server - use advanced-express-practice as an example
* The code for this goes in /src
* Use express to create a server listening on port 3001
* Use mongoose to connect to a MongoDB database called “checkpoint2”
* Create a Model for your thing
* Create a Route and Controller for your thing
* In the Route, create routes for getting all things, getting one thing by id, deleting one thing, updating one thing, and creating one thing
* In the Controller, create functions for list,show,create,update,remove

## Points
* When I yarn start, the web page loads with no errors - 10pts
* I can navigate to the list and create screen from links - 10pts
* I can enter information into the create screen and click save. If I go back to the list screen, that new information is there. - 20pts
* If I go to the list screen it will show all current existing information - 20pts
* The list screen has a view link for each item. If I click that link the detail screen appears. The details of the item are shown. - 20pts
* If I click the delete button on the list, the item I clicked will be removed from the list - 20pts


## Extra Credit
* Edit Component
  * Create a component to edit your things. It will be almost the same as the create component.
  * Use a prop that has the array of your models
  * Use a parameter from the route path /:id to find the model to show
  * Populate the properties of the model into the inputs
  * onSubmit populate the information from state back into the model, call a prop function called updateThing(thing)
* Create a container for the edit component
  * mapsStateToProps for the array of models
  * mapDispatchToProps for an action updateThing
* Create an action updateThing(thing)
  * do a fetch put to "/things/" + thing._id
  * when the fetch is complete, dispatch to loadThings
* In App.js, add a route to the edit container with a variable /:id
* In the list components,add a Link for the edit route.

## Bonus
* Create the edit component by reusing the create component
